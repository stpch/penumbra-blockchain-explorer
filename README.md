## Components, CSS, icons and fonts

The UI and theme replicate the provided [Figma mocks](https://bit.ly/3WRV2bK) as close as possible.
All components are built from scratch as <https://github.com/penumbra-zone/web> and
<https://ui.penumbra.zone/> don't seem to provide fitting ones for this task.

The project uses CSS modules with the global CSS and theme at `src/lib/css`. It uses modern CSS with
variables, flex, grid, animations, etc. Most components can be overridden with `className`. PostCSS
plugins add additional features such as normalizing and nesting. Tailwind was considered but
ultimately I went for this approach as I haven't used Tailwind in a while.

<https://lucide.dev/> is used for most icons. Some are custom and extracted from Figma.

The `Poppins` and `Work Sans` fonts are loaded with `next/font/google` whereas `Iosevka` is built
from source and loaded with `next/font/local` from `src/lib/fonts`.

## Linting

TypeScript is linted and autoformatted with ESLint and Prettier mimicking the configuration at
<https://github.com/penumbra-zone/web>. CSS is linted and autoformatted with Stylelint.

## Testing

Jest tests are collocated with the components. Global test configuration and mocks reside in
`src/__tests__`. Test coverage can be reported to console and written to file with
`npm run test:coverage`.

## CI/CD

On push, the GitHub Actions workflow `.github/workflows/gcp.yaml` is triggered. First it runs all
checks (linting, typechecking, testing) and uploads a test coverage report to Codecov with a badge
displayed at the top of this file. Then it triggers Google Cloud Build which deploys the app to
Google Cloud Run at <https://penumbra-blockchain-explorer-426149560589.europe-west6.run.app/>.

## Misc

- <https://day.js.org/> for date manipulation and formatting
- <https://fakerjs.dev/> to generate test data
- <https://github.com/glennreyes/react-countup> for dashboard number animation
- <https://github.com/lukeed/clsx> for conditional `className` construction

## What's missing

Due to time constraints the following things didn't make it:

- Some block and transaction view details
- Table pagination
- Interactive search input with popover
- Good test coverage
